# ST2195 Assignment 2

This repository contains the work for ST2195 Assignment 2. The main objective of this assignment is to practice basic data scraping and saving the data into CSV format using both R and Python programming languages.

## Repository Structure

- `r_csv/`: R project created with RStudio for scraping, transforming, and saving data.
  - `main.R`: Main script to run the R based tasks.
  - `scrape.R`: Script to scrape data.
  - `transform.R`: Script for data transformation.
  - `save.R`: Script to save data into a CSV file.

- `python_csv/`: Python project developed in PyCharm for similar tasks as in R.
  - `main.py`: Main script to run Python based tasks.
  - `scrape.py`: Script to scrape data.
  - `transform.py`: Script for data transformation.
  - `save.py`: Script to save data into a CSV file.

## Usage

- For R scripts, open the `r_csv` project in RStudio and run `main.R`.
- For Python scripts, open the `python_csv` project in PyCharm, set up a Python interpreter or a virtual environment, and then run `main.py`.

## Note

This assignment is part of the ST2195 Programming for Data Science course, focusing on a basic web scraping and data manipulation example in both R and Python.
